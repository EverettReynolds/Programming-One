Instructions on How To Run and Use My CSC Rainbow Six Teams Program

First, You will need to run the program.
You will be prompted to press one or two for Attacker or Defender respectively.
It does not matter which one you choose.

Second, you will be prompted to fill out the file name you would like to use for the testing. 
You can name it whatever you would like but please remember it for further testing.


Third, you will fill out your favorite ten names from that list of operators. 
You can choose whichever operators you like the most, and they will be wrote into a file.

Fourth, you will be asked to reenter your file name from earlier.

Fifth, You will narrow down your favorite operators form 10 to 5, then you will rate your operators
on a scale from 1-10 on how much you like them. 

Finally, there will be a report showing these names of the operators and how well you like them.
