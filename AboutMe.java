// Part 3 Answers
// a- 4+5=9
// b- There is an error here. You cannot end your statements with a colon. Instead, you need to end to end them with a semicolon.
// c- 9
// d- 1
// e- There is an error here. When you do operations, all numbers in the operations have to be the same type. This statement tries to divide a double by an int.
// f- There is an error here. Whenever you start a quote, you need to end it as well. This statement does not have an end quote.
// g- There is an error here. a and b are not defined as having values. Therefore, you cannot print out a statement saying a + b.
// h- 21
